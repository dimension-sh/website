    <h3>DONATE</h3>

    <p><b>dimension.sh</b> is a free to use service, always has been and always will be, but it does have some associated costs to operate the service. We keep costs down to a level that our admins can support financially even on no donations.</p>
    <p>If you wish to contribute towards the costs of operating the service, we appreciate it, but don't feel like you have to. Just by being a member of <b>dimension.sh</b> you're supporting the service.</p>

    <h4>Where will my donation be used?</h4>
    <p>Your donation will support the cost of running the dimension.sh servers, any excess donations will be re-distributed to other tilde projects on Liberapay to support the wider community.</p>

    <h4>What is your donation goal?</h4>
    <p>Our current goal is <b>&#163;2.00/week</b> which will allow us to expand 's1' to the next size of VM at DigitalOcean, and give us to have more resources to play around with on the system.</p>

    <h4>How to donate</h4>

    <p>At the moment, we accept donations via Liberapay.</p>
