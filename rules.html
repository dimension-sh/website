    <h3>RULES</h3>

    <p>We're not the type of people to heavily police everything that is going on, but we do have a few simple rules to follow:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><i>Be excellent to each other</i> - Be respectful to each other and the public.</li>
        <li>Don't do anything that could risk the service.</li>
        <li>Be a good neighbour and don't hog all the resources.</li>
    </ul>
