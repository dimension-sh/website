    <p><b>dimension.sh</b> is a small linux shell host trying to carry on the tradition of the original <b>dimension.spodnet.uk.com</b>, which was a collection of mixed Unix hosts ran at a UK college from 1997 to 2004. Over a decade after the loss of the system one of the members decided to start again, and lose themselves in the nostalgia of the early days online.</p>
