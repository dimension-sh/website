    <h3>WELCOME</h3>

    <p><b>dimension.sh</b> is a small linux shell host trying to carry on the tradition of the original <b>dimension.spodnet.uk.com</b>, which was a collection of mixed Unix hosts ran at a UK college from 1997 to 2004. Over a decade after the loss of the system one of the members decided to start again, and lose themselves in the nostalgia of the early days online.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to allow people access to that time where everything was command line based and <i>easier</i>, in the loosest sense. If you'd be interested in joining our community then you can read howto on the <a href="/join.html">JOIN</a> page.</a></p>
