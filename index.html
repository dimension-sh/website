    <h3>WELCOME</h3>

    <p><b>dimension.sh</b> is a collection of Linux shell hosts, trying to carry on the tradition of
      the original <b>dimension.spodnet.uk.com</b>; a small collection of mixed Unix hosts ran in a
      UK college from 1997 to 2004. A decade after the loss one of the original members of the system
      has decided to start again, and lose themselves in some nostalga of the early days online.</p>
