        <p><b>dimension.sh</b> is a small public linux shell host (or pubnix system) that is open to anyone who wants to
          learn, experiment, and socialize with other like minded people.</p>

        <p>We take the name from <b>dimension.spodnet.uk.com</b>, which was a collection of mixed Unix hosts ran at a UK
          college from 1997 to 2004. fifteen years after the shutdown of the system we decided to start again, with
          newer updated Linux and access to cheap resources.</p>
