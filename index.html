    <h3>WELCOME</h3>

    <p><b>dimension.sh</b> is a small public linux shell host (or pubnix system) that is open to anyone who wants to learn, experiment, and socialize with other like minded people.</p>
      
    <p>We take the name from <b>dimension.spodnet.uk.com</b>, which was a collection of mixed Unix hosts ran at a UK college from 1997 to 2004. fifteen years after the shutdown of the system we decided to start again, with newer updated Linux and access to cheap resources.</p>
