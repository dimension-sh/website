      <p>dimension was born on 10th October 1997. An old computer was resurrected from the ashes and reborn. From its
        slavery under Windows 95, dimension was given a new lease of life under linux. The box in question was a Dell
        Dimension series with a Pentium 75MHz processor and 16MB RAM.</p>

      <p>RedHat 4.0 was installed and I opened up the system in a 'secure' firewalled environment. A few users were
        granted access. News of the box spread in the local community until I was asked to put dimension on the net.</p>

      <p>dimension (mark I) had been liberated in fall of '97, however the new year brought a lack of machines at work,
        its fate was deemed to be that of workstation once more. To keep dimension alive the server is now running on
        one of my home PC's which I brought into work. It used to have Slackware on it and it was my main development
        machine for the past 3 years. After many processor updates from 486SX to DX2 to AMD DX4 (aw man that was bad),
        many hard disk updates, two new monitors, three new keyboards and three new cases, it now runs an Intel Pentium
        [233MHz] processor with 128MB RAM. Disk access is through an Adaptec 2940 controller card which run a 4GB
        Western Digital Caviar as well as a 9GB Seagate Barracuda....of course I could go on about it's supralight speed
        3x CDROM...but we don't talk about that part.</p>

      <p>dimension still runs on Redhat 4.2 (after an upgrade), under kernel 2.0.36. We nearly went Redhat 5.x but I
        found that a lot of older software was incompatable so we've stayed here till I fix the bugs...and to see</p>

      <p>dimension now supports more than 30 users with ranges of interest from houses to horseracing, linux to loo
        rolls (okay no loo rolls). We hold the official Stagefright(still under construction...come on Tracey!) and
        Idlewild band homepages. We run a Linux user group (thanks to qwaszx et al. for that one), IRC server, MUD and
        loads of other services to keep our members happy, as well as drag the Internet community to us.</p>

    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a> and our previous experience with <b>dimension v1</b> we decided to create a new home following the same ideals; just a bunch of people having fun with access to shared resources.</p>
